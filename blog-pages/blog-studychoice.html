        <p class="blog-item">In the past three years, I worked in the legal field, handling various legal matters and cases. Although my work in law was valuable, I found that my interest and passion for information technology (ICT) were growing stronger. Here are the specific reasons why I decided to choose ICT as my major:</p>
        <p class="blog-item"><b>Interest in Technology:</b> While working with legal matters, I frequently used technology tools and systems, such as electronic document management and legal research software. I became curious about how these technologies work and wanted to learn more about them.</p>
        <p class="blog-item"><b>Intersection of Law and Technology: </b>With technology becoming more important in the legal field, such as in managing electronic evidence, data protection laws, and cybersecurity, I realized that understanding ICT would help me better address these tech-related legal issues.</p>
        <p class="blog-item"><b>New Career Opportunities: </b>Although I value my work in law, I wanted to explore new career paths. The ICT field is growing quickly, and having technical skills will open up more opportunities and challenges for my career. I believe studying ICT will provide me with new career options.</p>
        <p class="blog-item"><b>Career Transition: </b>I wanted to change my career path and gain new skills. Technology is important in many industries, and future careers will rely more on technical skills. By studying ICT, I can transition from law to technology and reach my career goals.</p>
