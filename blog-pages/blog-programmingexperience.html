      <div>
          <p class="blog-item">Although I do not have any programming experience yet, I am very interested and excited to start learning. I have always been curious about how technology works and how software is created to solve real-world problems. Even though I haven't had the chance to write code, I have explored the basics of what programming involves by reading articles and watching tutorials online. This has made me even more eager to dive into the subject.</p>
          <p class="blog-item">I understand that learning to program might be challenging, especially in the beginning, but I am prepared to face these challenges. I plan to start with simple programming languages like Python, which is known to be beginner-friendly, and gradually work my way up to more complex concepts. I know that mastering coding takes time, so I am ready to put in consistent effort, practice regularly, and stay patient throughout the process.</p>
          <p class="blog-item">One of the things I'm most excited about is the opportunity to solve problems creatively through coding. I love the idea of breaking down a problem into smaller steps and figuring out how to make a program work. I am also looking forward to working on group projects and learning from my classmates and teachers, as I believe teamwork and collaboration are key in the ICT field.</p>
          <p class="blog-item">In addition, I understand the importance of time management and self-discipline in learning programming. I will make sure to set aside time every week for practicing code and reviewing class materials. I am confident that with the right mindset and dedication, I will be able to develop solid programming skills. Even though I am starting from scratch, I am excited about the journey ahead and all the possibilities that programming can offer.</p>
